## Working experience, projects and case championships:

### INTERNSHIP AT GLOWBYTE
- Field - Applied MLOps
- Worked with PySpark, Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD processes, Airflow, MLflow
- For the final project, a cookiecutter template was created for data scientists to compare a retrained model in production with an AutoML script (PyCaret) - link to the template on GitHub.

### Cup IT - High Quality Award - 15%
- Served as the project architect
- Conducted dataset analysis and identified key insights
- Designed a solution to increase SKU profitability for P&G by transferring information from merchandisers' phones (OpenCV) to Airflow for data orchestration, followed by the construction of an optimal store planogram

### Cup Moscow 2023

High quality award - 25%

- Developed initiatives for the introduction of children's products into the company to increase the company's margins
- Tested hypotheses and highlighted the most promising initiatives in the short and long term
- Built a financial model for possible case solutions

### Case championship of the company “Samolyot” - 2023

- Development of a model for determining the location of openings for exterior envelopes (cells)
  of a building under construction on the basis of photos of its facade, and determination of the degree of readiness of
  the corresponding   
  cells (yolo v8 model)
- Subsequent implementation of docker container to run the program on a remote server.

### Case championship of the company “Gazprom” - 2023

Implementing a machine learning algorithm to predict the price of goods for the next 90 days for 5 cities, subject to
the following conditions

- One price for a product must be held for more than 3 days (i.e., it is impossible to
  set a price for one day and change it the next day).
- it is forbidden to change the price by more than 1 gold at a time (i.e. you cannot
  change the price from 3 gold pieces to 4.50 gold pieces, but you can change the price from 3 gold pieces to 4.50 gold
  pieces and then 3 days later to 4.50 gold pieces.
  gold and then raise it to 4.5 gold 3 days later)
- Don't be tempted to set the price too high - everyone will refuse to buy from you,
  And if the Ancient Gods notice that your price is 20% higher than your competitors', they can
  may punish you for your greed (with a heavy fine).

has implemented such machine learning models as **GRU, SARIMA, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVR, and LSTM as a final
choice with the best accuracy.**   
(You can see the report and the models themselves in the Gazprom folder)

### Study projects 2022-2023

- Developed models for forecasting the state of power grid facilities and
  electricity consumption by organizations and enterprises (lstm, gradient
  boosting, snn, spiking nn) with further analysis of the impact of forecast
  values on technical and industrial facilities.
- Developed models for forecasting the water level of the Republic of
  Bashkortostan (gradient boosting, polly regression, RNN, SNN) with site
  realization on django.

### IRES GROUP 2022 - present

- Data mining to analyze real estate market needs
- Parsing of the company's website using Python(BS4, json, xml, requests)
- Autonomous loading of objects into CRM system
- Creating presentations (Figma) for clients
